# TDD-BasicDemos - Test-Driven Development Examples

This repository contains basic **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** examples in different programming languages. It serves as a learning resource for understanding TDD principles through simple, practical implementations.

## ðŸ“Œ What is TDD?

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual implementation code. The cycle follows:

1. **Red** â†’ Write a failing test
2. **Green** â†’ Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **Refactor** â†’ Improve code while keeping tests passing

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Languages Used

- **JavaScript** (Jest)
- **Python** (pytest)
- **Java** (JUnit)
- **C#** (xUnit/NUnit)
- **Ruby** (RSpec)
